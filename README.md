# Japanese-Memrise-Enhancements
A Google Chromeâ„¢ extension that enhances your Japanese learning experience on memrise.com.
Memrise is great for learning Japanese vocabulary, but it has a few shortcomings in that , which this browser extension seeks to mitigate. 

## Features

### Timer
The timer on Memrise just adds artificial difficulty. You remember things by recalling them and the harder it is to recall a word, the more effective the learning is (given of course that you do eventually manage to recall the word). The obnoxious timer is absolutely counterproductive in this regard.

In the default settings the extension automatically pauses the timer whenever a new word appears and also keeps Memrise from unpausing the timer if for example you pause the session and return. You can also click on the timer to (un-)pause it.
