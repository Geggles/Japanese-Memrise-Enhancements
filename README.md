# Japanese-Memrise-Enhancements
A Google Chromeâ„¢ extension that enhances your Japanese learning experience on memrise.com.
Memrise is great for learning Japanese vocabulary, but it has a few shortcomings in that , which this browser extension seeks to mitigate. 

## Features

### Timer
The timer on Memrise just adds artificial difficulty. You remember things by recalling them and the harder it is to recall a word, the more effective the learning is (given of course that you do eventually manage to recall the word). The obnoxious timer is absolutely counterproductive in this regard.

In the default settings the extension automatically pauses the timer whenever a new word appears and also keeps Memrise from unpausing the timer if for example you pause the session and return. You can also click on the timer to (un-)pause it.

### Typing kana
Usually you would need an external IME to input kana if you don't have a japanese keyboard (or respective key-mappings), but those are rather tedious and sometimes contain auto correction and text prediction, which is not what you want when learning Japanese words. Also you have to switch the input back to roman letters when you need to input English again.

This extension uses the open source WanaKana javascript IME (http://wanakana.com/) to automatically converts your roman input to kana as you type whenever you are prompted by Memrise for kana input.
